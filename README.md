# Add the Numbers Game
This is a boardgame in which the player tries to get the highest score by moving a tile with a numerical value.<br/>
Each turn, the player can move the tile in one of the four main directions. This move will replace another tile, adding its value to the player's score.<br/>
The goal is for the player to exceed the minimal given score in the given number of moves.<br/><br/>
